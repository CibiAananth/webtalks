## Chrome extension overview

* They are built on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

* In addition to Web APIs, Chrome extensions can use the [Chrome extension APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference).

* Chrome extensions are made up of different components such as background scripts, content scripts, popup, options page, etc.

* The manifest file is the heart of a Chrome extension. It contains metadata about the extension such as name, version, permissions, etc.

* Chrome extensions can be published to the Chrome Web Store or distributed privately as a .zip file.

<!-- 
Background scripts, content scrips are all js files and we'll see about popup and others in a bit 
Here we are not going to cover all the components of a chrome extension, but we'll see how to build a simple chrome extension using Vite.
