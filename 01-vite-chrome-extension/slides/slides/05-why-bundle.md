## Why do we need to bundle a Chrome extension?

<div class="mt-3">

* Chrome extensions are made up of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

* Just like any webapp, these needs to be bundled to improve performance (loading time, network requests, etc).

* Bundling is the process of combining multiple files into a single file and minifying them.

* This is done using bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, etc.
